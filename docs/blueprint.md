Prompt:

I need you to implement a scalable REST API for a new eCommerce platform using Python. The API should be built with one of the following frameworks: Django, Flask, or FastAPI. The platform should be capable of handling high-volume concurrent requests, with efficient management of product information, customer data, and order processing.

Project Requirements:

Entities to be managed:

Products

Customers

Orders

Endpoints to be created:

CRUD Operations for the entities above (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Search, Filter, and Sort functionality for the entities, such as filtering products by price or category, sorting by date of order, etc.

Authentication and Authorization:

Implement a secure authentication mechanism (JWT or OAuth).

Ensure that users can sign up, log in, and access specific endpoints based on roles (e.g., customers can only access their orders, admin can manage all entities).

Performance Considerations:

The API should be optimized for high concurrency and handle a large number of requests efficiently.

Documentation and Setup:

Provide clear and detailed steps on how to run the API locally.

Include instructions for setting up the development environment, installing dependencies, and running tests.

Host the code on GitHub.

Clearly mention any assumptions made during development and any third-party libraries used.
